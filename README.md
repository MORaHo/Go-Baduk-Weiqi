##Rules of Go

Go isn't too hard of a game once you have played it, so for the rules I would recommmend:
1. Reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)

or

2. Learning to play at https://online-go.com/

## Known Problems

1. Currently accepts inputs outside of technically legal board bounds
2. Algorithm for checking if a move is legal or not is too slow, so if there the board it clicked to quickly a technically illegal move can be played.
